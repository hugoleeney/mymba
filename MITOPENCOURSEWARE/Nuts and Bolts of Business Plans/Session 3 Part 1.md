# Equity deal vs convertible note

Convertible Note is:
- agree to borrow money unless event occurs and it turns into equity
- 1-2 page document
- debt has downside if things go badly - investor become creditor
- option value of doing deal later for investor
- don't have to agree on valuation for founder
- temporary instrument

# most important question

- never have complete intelligence
- even with same motivations you have honest difference of opinion
- different goals and you have a problem
- so 'what is success' is very important
- always ask 'why'
  - why this team
  - why this money in this way ...

# what sums of money

- 3-7 million is typical for tech
- biotech is bigger
- alwways exceptions
  - e.g. big rounds for emerging winner, getting in early and being involved
- VCs don't what to own huge amounts of venture backed company because its a bad sign
- stopwatch starts when money is handed over - so you should be ready to run

# what are the biggest problems for people raising money

- do they have a rolodex
- what happens when things get difficult
- follow on financing
- working with strategic investors
- at exit
- management team building
- when there isa problem with ceo ...

# how do you raise

- you cold call
  - low return on time
- you get referred
  - you get higher in the queue
- you get a cold call

# when does a project become a business/product

- questions become answers
  - work becomes boring!
- transitions science experiment to technology
- Axel: nurture network early then listen to them .. 

# pitfalls

- amount of capital relative to opportunity size
- strategic investors - when they don't just have strategic investor
  - take professionals first at least
- making decisions unanimous
- look for investors who ask questions and are interested
- get rid of your biggest risks, as fast as possible with least amount of money
