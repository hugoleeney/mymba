Crappy gross margins!

Revenue per employee is similar in industry.

Note how Revenue per employee is so much higher for Cisco.

Note how Dell (simple manufacturer) is not like Cisco.

Few companies have an operating profit of 40-50% but that is probably unlikely. You should look at more staff/higgher costs...

Distributor doesn't eliminat marketting sales etc but can reduce them.

Can distrubutor get you to market faster or reach growth targets faster?

Benefit of exersize of building model is understanding, debugging it. If operating profit is 50% then maybe something is wrong.

Sales projections from bottom up not top down. (i.e. not there are X number of buyers and we expect 5% of that market).

Look at contingencies but don't present more than one model (best case, worst case) to VCs.

Producing cash flow is REALLY hard!

Proxy for cash flow is cumulative operating losses and any capital expenses.

Pay yourself the same that your peers might earn (within reason).
