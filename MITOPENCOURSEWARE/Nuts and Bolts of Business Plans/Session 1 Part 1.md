Plan not about the technology - about what it can enable.

Investors are looking for

- why this? why should I be interested in it?
  - is it a big problem in the world
- why now? why is now the right time?
- why this team?
- why won't this work?
  - part of the trick is to lead people to the right conclusion

How to make the first cut?

- an idea too good to ignore
- a financial promise too good to turn down
- a team good enough to believe in
- an action plan that's
  - credible
  - focused
- details that give assurance of insight, commitment and follow through
- format and style that show
  - passion
  - sanity

how to fail the first cut

- insufficient market
- non-credible technology
  - too wild, blue sky, un-protectible, too mundane
- investment too large for the promise
- failure to understand the market
- action plan not credible
  - too optimistic
  - naive about the hurdles
  - too many directions
  - not ambitious enough
  - regulatory barriers insufficiently addressed
  - gaps filled by handwaving
  - no promises at all
- team not credible
- cosmetic reasons
- can't understand it
- naive writing/projections
- ignores basics
